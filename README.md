This repo provides a demo app for the [Shortcut Android SDK](https://github.com/shortcutmedia/shortcut-sdk-android).
With included demo keys you are able to scan the [Lenna test image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna).

To be able to recognize your own items you need to add your own access key and secret token in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file. You can get your keys by emailing support@shortcutmedia.com.
